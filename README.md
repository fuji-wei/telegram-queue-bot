# nusc-queue-bot
Implements a Telegram bot for small to medium-scale events that involve queueing, such as for photobooths. Meant for NUSC events, but can be used in any other queue setting.

Inspired by deprecated queue bot counterparts written in Python here:

This repository uses Go so that scalability with concurrency will not become an issue.
